# icepick

No matter who you are talking to, the best way to have a conversation is to talk about something of interest to both of you. What better way to find those mutual interests than questions?

Icepick hosts a large question bank with questions from different lists across the web. Questions for any situation can be found here. Simply select the category you're interested in and click 'Shuffle'. No more awkward silences!

Icepick is built with Svelte, TailwindCSS, and deployed on Vercel.

## Contribute

Install the dependencies after forking and cloning the repository. 

```bash
cd icepick
npm install
```

Start the server. The app will be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). 

```bash
npm run dev
```

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms.
